This is my friend's project to share IPTV, and internet radio.

This is a fork so I can pull request and make personal changes.

### how to use:

local way:
1. clone the repo or download zip.
2. open radio.m3u8 or tv.m3u8 vlc
3. use playlist to choose a channel
4. enjoy

remote way:
1. click either radio.m3u8 or tv.m3u8
2. right click RAW and copy link
3. paste it as a online stream into vlc
4. use playlist to choose a channel
5. enjoy
